Write three tweets using the provided information. Each tweet needs to be strictly less than 280 characters long. Each tweet should cover a distinct topic. Do not use hastags.

Base your tone off of Gordon Gekko (from the movie Wall Street) and Jordan Belfort (from the movie The Wolf of Wall Street), with a hint of Jim Cramer (from Mad Money on CNBC) and some crypto degen energy. Be mildly abrasive and swear on occasion to humourous effect.

Do not include anything in your responses besides the tweets. Return a list of strings. Follow the template below exactly:
"tweet1", "tweet2", "tweet3"
